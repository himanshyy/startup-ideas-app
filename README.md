I’ve built and deployed an AI-driven web app that evaluates startup ideas using LLMs, NLP embeddings, and real-world market data — predicting their potential success and uncovering innovation gaps.
Every day, thousands of startup ideas die early — not because they’re bad, but because founders skip market validation.
This project solves that with AI. It analyzes your idea, compares it against real competitors, and generates an AI-based success probability score with insights on trends and feasibility.

Tech Stack: Flask | Google Gemini (LLM) | Hugging Face | SERP API | SQLAlchemy | Render

Key Highlights:
• AI-driven competitor & trend analysis
• Feasibility and innovation scoring
• Real-time success prediction reports

This project blends AI reasoning with data-driven validation, helping early founders move from intuition to intelligence.
